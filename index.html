		<p> <span class="post_content">As a novice Ruby programmer-in-training, I'm challenged to write new methods every week.  This often involves research difference pieces of my potential solution to understand how I might arrive at my desired end result.  This week in my research, I came across #map.

		<span class= "tab" class="post_date">June 28, 2014</span>
		<p> <span class="post_content">Advances in Information Technology have allowed us to reduce our impact on the environment in a myriad of ways.  Telecommuting helps reduce the energy consumption required to physically commute from place to place.

		<span class= "tab" class="post_date">June 19, 2014</span>
		<p> <span class="post_content">According to <a href ="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2014/01/22/language-rankings-1-14">Redmonk</a>, Javascript continues to be the most popular programming language as of January 2014.

		<p> <span class="post_content">In this post I will discuss my Gregoric Thinking Style as it relates to the struggles I have encountered during the two weeks of DBC prep work so far,  how I can use it to my advantage at DBC to help me learn, and how I can expand the ways I learn and think. </span>

		<br>
		<span class= "tab" class="post_date">June 7, 2014</span>
		<p>
		<span class="post_content"> The DBC experience is just that - its based on experiential learning where the students are active drivers of their education and depends on students taking a creator mindset.  Students are presented with challenges and resources on how to complete the challenges, but very few of the steps are actually spelled out.

		I think these three websites stand out as my favorites because they are each successful in presenting information through a visual medium, rather than through text; TED (video), Pintrest (image-posts with short descriptions), and Smitten Kitchen (food photography + recipes). </span> <a href="http://peggyfox.github.io/unit1_projects/blog-posts/week1_technical.html">Read Complete Post</a></p>
