		<span class="post_content"> <a href="www.ted.com">TED</a> // <a href="www.smittenkitchen.com">Smitten Kitchen</a> // <a href="www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>
		<br>
		I think these three websites stand out as my favorites because they are each successful in presenting information through a visual medium, rather than through text; TED (video), Pintrest (image-posts with short descriptions), and Smitten Kitchen (food photography + recipes). </span> <a href="http://peggyfox.github.io/blog-posts/week1_technical.html">Read Complete Post</a></p>
