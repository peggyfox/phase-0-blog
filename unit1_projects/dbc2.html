			<h4 class="report_type">School Progress Reports</h4>
				<p class="report_desc">The School Progress Report contains key metrics for the school with two years of data for most metrics.
				Metrics include test score national attainment percentiles and growth percentiles, graduation rates, college enrollment rates, 
				dropout rates, and attendance rates. The report also includes the results of the <a href="https://illinois.5-essentials.org/2013/">
				5Essentials Survey</a>, which is administered to students, parents, and teachers at the school each year.</p>
				<p class="report_location">The School Progress Report is located on each school's CPS school page under Progress Reports.  This page can be accessed by searching
				the school on <a href="http://www.cps.edu/schools/find_a_school/pages/findaschool.aspx">Find a School</a>.
		
			<h4 class="report_type">Performance Policy and School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP)</h4>
				<p class="report_desc">Previous to the 2013-2014 School Year, schools in CPS were rated on the "Performance Policy".  
					Schools received a rating of Level 1, 2, or 3, and this rating determined the degree to which the School Board could 
					intervene in the operation and administration of the school.  In the 2013-2014 a new rating system, called the "School Quality	
					Rating Policy" (SQRP) was implemented.  Schools will now be rated as Tier 1 through Tier 5.  No schools have yet to be rated
					according to the new policy.
				<p class="report_location">The Performance Policy is located on each school's CPS school page under Reports.  This page can be accessed by searching
				the school on <a href="http://www.cps.edu/schools/find_a_school/pages/findaschool.aspx">Find a School</a>.
