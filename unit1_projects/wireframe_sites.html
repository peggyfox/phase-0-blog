		<p> <span class="post_content"> Web Design is a process that begins with user experience and ends with the actual writing of code.  Check out the beginning stage of sketching a websites design with these wireframes of my favorite sites. </span></p>

		<span class="subheader"> Smitten Kitchen
		</span>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.smittenkitchen.com">Smitten Kitchen</a> website is a Wordpress site that uses a blog format. The website provides recipes accompanied by photography of the food through each step in the preparation.  The challenge on this site is to balance content with images, which it does beautifully. </p>

		<span class="subheader"> Pinterest
		</span>
		<p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> focuses on providing visual content but is challenged to do so in a way that does not appear blocky or cumbersome.  They prevent this by presenting each post in individual containers that vary in size.  Each container is presented using a random layout for each container so as to give a continuous and asymetrical appearance.</p>

		<span class="subheader">TED
		</span>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> website gives access to recorded speeches given at TED conferences by inspirational thinkers and experts.  The challenge is to present the range of video content available so that a diverse viewership will find at least one video of interest to them on the homepage.  An additional challenge is to present the options in a way that does not appear blocky or heavy.  They succeed in having the videos maintain an agile feel by presenting them asymetrically and having them expand an the screen as you hover over them. </p>
