		<span class="post_content"> Web Design is a process that begins with user experience and ends with the actual writing of code.  Check out the beginning stage of sketching a website's layout with these wireframes of my favorite sites.

		<span class="post_title">The DBC Experience</span>
		<br>
		<span class= "tab" class="post_date">June 7, 2014</span>
		<p>
		<span class="post_content"> The DBC experience is just that - its based on experiential learning where the students are active drivers of their education and depends on students taking a creator mindset.  Students are presented with challenges and resources on how to complete the challenges, but very few of the steps are actually spelled out.

		<span class= "tab" class="post_date">June 6, 2014</span>

		<span class="post_content"> <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> // <a href="http://www.smittenkitchen.com">Smitten Kitchen</a> // <a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>
		<br>
		I think these three websites stand out as my favorites because they are each successful in presenting information through a visual medium, rather than through text; TED (video), Pintrest (image-posts with short descriptions), and Smitten Kitchen (food photography + recipes). </span> <a href="http://peggyfox.github.io/unit1_projects/blog-posts/week1_technical.html">Read Complete Post</a></p>
