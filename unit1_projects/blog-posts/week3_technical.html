		<span class="title">Why is JavaScript so Popular?</span>
		<br>
		<span class="post_date">June 19, 2014</span>
		<p>
		<span class="post_content"> According to <a href ="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2014/01/22/language-rankings-1-14">Redmonk</a>, Javascript continues to be the most popular programming language as of January 2014.  Redmonk determines popularity using Github and Stackoverflow.  So why is JavaScript so popular in web development?  What is great about it and what are its limitations?

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> What is JavaScript and why is it great?</h3>
		<p>In the most basic sense, JavaScript changes a webpage from being static to dynamic.   How does it do this?  By communicating with the browser instead of with the server.  This allows changes to be made to the webpage without fully reloading it (which would require communicating with the server.  For example, say you are filling out a form on a static webpage.  You enter the information into the spaces provided and then you click a button to submit this information.  If the form is not using JavaScript, the page will reload, possibly with an error message saying that you didn&#39t put the date in the right format.  If the form is using JavaScript, you will get a pop-up message on the original form as soon as you enter the date.  The page performs the check before you enter submit. </p>
		<p>When we assess why JavaScript is popular, it really comes down to speed.  JavaScript enhances and accelerates both the development and the user experience.  Let&#39s look at a few ways it does this:</p>
		<h4>User Experience:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Because a request is only sent to the browser and not all the way to the server, JavaScript allows webpages to perform faster.</li>
			<li>Asynchronous: This means that not only are pages responsive, but they can handle multiple requests at the same time.  Going back to our form example, this means that the form can continue to verify that you entered the date in the right format, while at the same time verifying your credit card information, which may take longer.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Development:</h4>
			<p> The main advantage to JavaScript on the development side is that it works across devices.  When I was growing up,the internet was accessed from 1 of 2 browsers (Internet Explorer or Netscape) on 1 of 2 devices (Mac or PC), from a standard screen size on our home desktop computer.  Now there are numerous browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla, to name a few), that work on various devices (Android, iPhone, Chromebooks), on practically infinite screen sizes from smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops.  Because Javascript works within the browser, it can be used on all of these devices and it works fairly successfully with the different browser types.  This allows developers to focus on one programming language rather than using different languages based on the device.  Focusing on one language, allows developers to truly focus on development, rather than switching between multiple languages and following different rules with each.</p>
		
		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> What are the drawbacks of JavaScript?</h3>
				<p>One main criticism of JavaScript is the classic warning to not pull all your eggs in one basket.  Due to the complexity of web applications and uses, no one language is going to fit for every solution.   There are additional drawbacks that result from the very aspects that make JavaScript popular:</p>

		<h4>User Experience:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Makes bookmarking difficult.  Because the webpage is not static, it may be difficult to return to the webpage in the particular state that you desire.</li>
			<li>Working with a poor internet connection: With poor internet connections, when a script is run, there may be a delay in the return of information that can be disruptive to the browsing experience.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Development:</h4>
			<p> In terms of learning JavaScript, the language looks similar to other languages (like C), but is actually different in some important ways.  This may make it somewhat difficult for developers because it can trip them up in key ways.</p>
			<p>In full disclosure, there is a lot of criticism out there for JavaScript and I read through many resources but I still was not able to really feel like I got to the heart of the issue.  This may be due to my lack of a deeper understanding of JavaScript and other programming languages, but it also might be due to critics&#39 inability express themselves clearly.  I think it&#39s a combination of the two.</p>
