		<span class="post_date">June 16, 2014</span>
		<p>
		<span class="post_content"> In this post I will discuss my Gregoric Thinking Style as it relates to the struggles I have encountered during the two weeks of DBC prep work so far,  how I can use it to my advantage at DBC to help me learn, and how I can expand the ways I learn and think.

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> Gregoric Thinking Styles</h3>
		<p>First, some background on Gregoric Thinking Styles.  The Styles are ways of understanding how the mind works.  The Styles include one of two Perceptual Qualities and one of two Ordering Abilities:</p>
		<h4>Perceptual Qualities:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Concrete: Dealing with what’s tangible.</li>
			<li>Abstract: Thinking about relationships, ideas, and theories.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Ordering Abilities:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Sequential: Works systematically, organizes information linearly.</li>
				<li>Random: Works in no particular order, may bounce around from one project to another or work backwards within a project.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> Characteristics of each Thinking Style:</h3>
				<p><span class="terms">> Concrete Sequential:</span> Prefers using logic, working in structured environments and finds it difficult to work in groups and with uncertainty or abstract ideas.</p>
				<p><span class="terms">> Abstract Sequential:</span> Prefers analyzing situations and applying logic to solving problems, learns best both alone and surrounded by resources, and finds it difficult to express their emotions and to tackle problems when there is too little time to understand a topic fully.</p>
				<p><span class="terms">> Concrete Random:</span> Prefers experimenting and independent problem-solving, working through trial-and-error, and finds it difficult to work in structured environments.</p>  
				<p><span class="terms">> Abstract Random:</span> Learns best focusing on the present and on positive relationships but finds it difficult to concentrate on just one thing and work in restrictive environments.</p>

		<h4>My Thinking Style is Abstract Sequential.</h4>  

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> Phase 0 Struggles Resulting from Abstract Sequential Thinking</h3>

			<p>In reflection on my struggles with the DBC prep work thus far, I think many of them are related to my thinking style.  My two main challenges stem from (1) not being able to immerse myself fully in the work and from (2) working remotely.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>I prefer to work in a very systematic way and to completely delve into my work (I think this is in many ways why I enjoy programming).  I like to see the big picture and analyze all of the variables before tackling a problem.  However, during Phase 0, I am not able to commit myself full-time to the material.  I do not have as much time as I would like to work through everything and to feel completely satisfied with my work before moving on to the next task.  I also find that since I am balancing a full-time job, personal commitments, and DBC pre-work that includes both challenges and pairing sessions, I am not able to work systematically.  I have to take the work in chunks and try to figure out what I can accomplish based on my available time – what could I get done in 45 minutes on my work computer during my lunch break?  What challenges are appropriate for pairing and when are accountability group members available to pair up to work on those?  How much time do I think I can realistically commit to this challenge and when am I going to have to be comfortable moving on, even if I am not completely satisfied?  Trying to juggle all of these different aspects have left me feeling kind of anxious at all times about when I am going to be able to finish the work.</li>

				<li>I appreciate having experts and working in stimulating environments.  Because I personally find it more difficult to have to reach out to someone, I am less likely to take advantage of the experts available because they are not in my physical environment.  I much prefer to work with people face to face.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> DBC Advantages Derived from Abstract Sequential Thinking</h3>

			<p>Just as I have found it difficult to bounce around between the Phase 0 material, once I start DBC full-time, I think this thinking style will be to my advantage.  I will be able to commit myself to the work, literally, around the clock.  Also, as I find the remote work difficult, once at DBC, I will be in a highly stimulating environment with numerous experts and resources available to me.</p>

			<p>I also thinking the DBC model is very conducive to my thinking style.  Under this model, we are given semi-structured challenges and the freedom to work through them.  Because I like to work systematically, if I have no structure, I find it difficult to tackle a problem.  On the other hand, if I am given too much structure, I am not given room to conceptualize the problem or to use my imagination to solve it.</p>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span> Expanding My Learning and Thinking Style</h3>

			<p>During DBC, I think I will be most challenged by the paired programming and group work.  Similar to finding too much structure to be limiting to my ability to conceptualize a problem and to use my imagination to solve it, I also find working with others to inhibit this aspect of my preferred thinking style.  I also often find it difficult to express my viewpoint and emotions, which is another aspect of my thinking style that makes it difficult for me to work with others.  Working collaboratively is an important skill to develop and is a key way that I will need to expand my learning and thinking style during DBC.</p>
