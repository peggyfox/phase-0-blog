		I think these three websites stand out as my favorites because they are each successful in presenting information through a visual medium, rather than through text; TED (video), Pintrest (image-posts with short descriptions), and Smitten Kitchen (food photography + recipes). I think the reason they are successful is because their websites have a very clean look.  The viewer is able to focus on the content without distraction. </p>
		<p>The strength of each of these three websites is that they have a very clean look.  How do they accomplish this?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>White space & background: structurally each of these sites has uses the color white as a main component, either in the background (TED and Smitten Kitchen) or in their content.</li>
			<li>'Bright': because of the white space, each of the sites appears bright instead of dark or dull.</li>
			<li>Content is centered on the page.  Two of the sites have an approximately 100 pixel border and each side of the centered content.  This has the affect of drawing your eye directly to the content.</li>
			<li>Dark grey font: All of the sites primarily use dark grey font for headers and navigation-related elements.  It seems to help the site look more modern and the white space to not appear as stark.</li>
			<li>Little-to-no header:  On Smiten Kitchen the content begins at the top of the page.  TED has a very small logo on its header and the content begins immediately below it.  Pinterest also has a small logo in the center of the header, with the search bar to the left and the profile bar  to the right also in the header.</li>
			<p>Due to the clean look, each of the sites has a very light (as in weight) feel.  They do not feel dark and heavy, rather they are bright and agile.  The content “pops” and feels likes its coming off the screen, rather than stuck to it.  They are also very easy to navigate, which contributes to a fluid browsing experience.</p>
			<p>What I like about these websites is that the content on each provides me with ideas to incorporate in my own life.  From watching TED talks, I receive insights into modern life.  From Smitten Kitchen, I not only find delicious and trust-worthy recipes, but the accompanying photos help me visualize how the preparation show look at each step.  From Pintrest, I get ideas about clothing or decorating that help me make my surrounding more beautiful.  That old tennis racket I made into a place to hang earrings and necklaces?  Pintrest-inspired.  None of these sites sell anything, rather they provide me with tools to seek out what I need.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, each of these sites leaves me feeling inspired after I have spent some time on them - which is why I don&#39t normally spend much time on them at all.  I get inspired to stop surfing the web and go do or cook or make something.</p>
