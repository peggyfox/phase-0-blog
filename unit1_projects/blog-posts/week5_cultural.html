		<span class="post_content"> Paired programming is an important part of Dev Bootcamp&#39s model.  The importance of pairing stems from the concept that everyone has something to teach as well as to learn, and that through pairing you are able to accelerate your learning and to solidify your understanding of concepts by teaching others.  A second reason why pairing sessions are so important is that they provide people feedback on how they are progressing and how they work with others.

		<p>The process of pairing and giving feedback is intimidating because of how exposed our weakness are to one another.  And they are not just exposed, they are communicated back to us!  EH!  I think Brene Brown&#39s Ted Talk <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability">"The Power of Vulnerability"</a> really explains how difficult being vulnerable to others can be and how important it is for embracing the best parts of life.  As I go through DBC, I am trying to remember her words and not shy away from these experiences of vulnerability.</p>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>Pairing</h3>
		<p>I have been apprehensive about pairing for a number of reasons.  First, I tend to prefer to work individually, so I do not usually get too excited about having to work in pairs or groups.  Second, I usually fear that I will be underprepared for our sessions and that it won&#39t end up being very productive for the other person.  In that sense, I fear it will be embarrassing that I don&#39t know as much as the other person.  I think as we are working remotely during our pre-work (&#39Phase 0&#39) period, it is also just seems difficult/awkward to video chat and work with someone you&#39ve never met before. </p>

		<p> After each pairing session, however, I always feel relief.  After getting all nervous about the sessions, I always feel like they were very beneficial and that I was not holding the other person back.  I have found that the video conferences with strangers have not been uncomfortable at all, perhaps because we have a bond because we are sharing a very intense and life changing experience.  During most of these sessions, I have felt like my abilities were somewhat behind with my pair, but not so far behind that I couldn't keep up with the work or challenge, or at least have something small to offer to the other person.</p>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>Feedback</h3>

		<p> The important second component to pairing is providing and receiving feedback from your pair.  DBC is a proponent of feedback as it helps us improve the way we work with one another, thereby improving the experience for us all during DBC and molding us into more effective communicators and more capable employees.</p>

		<p> For me, the idea of reading feedback makes me want to hide under a table.  I have nonetheless found that this, too, is not as bad as I&#39ve made it out to be.  I think we are still all learning to write good feedback, so we have not yet had too much to put down, either positive or negative.  I have found for myself and in reading my feedback that the feedback process is often reflective for the person giving the feedback.  It forces us to look to things we both did well and both could have improved.  It causes us to be reflective on how we interact as a pair and how we could improve.  I think for the most part, we would not give feedback to someone that we also didn&#39t then remind ourselves that it is something we should be doing as well.  </p>

		<p> Feedback is difficult to give as often during pairing I am so focused on the code and they seem to go so smoothly, that I can&#39t quite recall what we both did to contribute or detract from the session.  I think making notes of what happened in the session and reflecting on it immediately afterwards will help me provided more detailed feedback to my pairs.</p>

		<p> Based on the feedback I have received, I&#39m going to remember to take a more goal-oriented and methodical approach to sessions.  When I get stuck, I tend to get quiet and think things over in my head, and I&#39m getting better about talking out what I&#39m thinking (instead of just thinking it).</p>
