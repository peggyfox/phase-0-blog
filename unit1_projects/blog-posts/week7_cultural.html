		<span class="post_content">In this blog post I'll reflect on some of the values that are most important to me, rate how I try to live up to them, and explore one in particular and why it is of importance to me.  I will also reflect on a time I was asked for advice and how I might give myself advice on mediating self-doubt during DBC.</p>

			<p>When I think of a time in my life when I have been the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied, the following values come to mind.  In parenthesis, I have noted on a scale from 1 (not very) to 5 (very) of how successful I am in living up to these values.  Generally, I think all of these values are really important to me, but some come more naturally to me, while I need to work on others.</p>

						<ul>
						<li>Honesty(4)</li>
						<li>Initiative(4)</li>
						<li>Accountability(3)</li>
						<li>Inquisitiveness(3)</li>
						<li>Empathy(5)</li>
						<li>Enthusiasm(4)</li>
						<li>Acceptance(5)</li>
						</ul>

			<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>Enthusiasm!</h3>

			<p>When I reflect on the happiest and most satisfied periods in my life, I think enthusiasm was one of the most important values that I embraced.  Enthusiasm is seizing the day and taking a positive attitude.  I can often have a tendency to be overwhelmed by a full schedule, but when I remember to embrace enthusiasm, I remind myself that all of the things I fill my life with are things I want to or should be doing.  I remember to live in the moment and to enjoy what I'm doing.  Being enthusiastic about what I like doing makes me enjoy it even more, and being enthusiastic about things I may not be excited about helps me find the positive in every situation.</p>


			<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>Advice</h3>
			<p>The last thing someone asked for my advice on was how to navigate a work conversation to approach our manager about a concern.  I think this person looked to me for advice because I am very honest, so I told him exactly what I thought.  I also think I'm pretty empathetic, which helps me see both sides and both perspectives, even if I may not agree with one or the other.  I was therefore able to give him some advice on how our manager might interpret his concerns and what kind of appeals would be most successful.</p>

			<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>Values and the Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p>My values are characteristics that I <em>value</em> in myself and in others.  I feel like they encompass the virtues that I aspire to - I do not always live up to them, but I do not feel I fall too far short and do not beat myself up if I don't live up to them.  I think each of these values can help me mediate stereotype threat by giving me perspective on my goals and what's important.</p>

			<p>I think enthusiasm will be especially important when I may be feeling down at DBC.  If I am discouraged, tired, or frustrated, I will need to remember that I really do love what I'm doing and that I want to keep doing it.</p>
