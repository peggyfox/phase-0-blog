		<span class="post_content">In this post I'll present some of the research that I have done on the Compass of Shame and how it relates to the sources of and responses to conflict.  I will then reflect on how I have dealt with conflict in the past.</p>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>What are the Sources of Conflict?</h3>

			<h4>Sources of Conflict</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Interpersonal: personality clashes, differing desires, etc.</li>
				<li>Organizational: I think these are like second-degree factors that affect how two people interact.  In the DBC setting, it could be due to lack of clarity on an assignment. In the workplace these often result from management.</li>
				<li>External factors: I think of these like third-degree factors.  They may affect an organization which thereby affects the individuals within.  They may also affect a person directly but the thing about external factors is that they donâ€™t have a personal component.  One example is lack of resources.  This can result in resource conflicts.</li>
				<li>Change: This a specific kind of external factor that forces people to alter their behaviors.</li>
			</ul>


			<h4>Root Causes: Poor Communication</h4>

			<p>In my research of root causes of conflict, I saw Poor Communication listed alongside the other sources. I think that this is really a root cause that underlies why each of the other sources can erupt in conflict.  Just because there may be problems associated with the above sources, does not necessarily mean that conflict will arise.  Poor communication leads to misunderstanding in all four of the conditions above.</p>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>How do people typically respond to Conflict?</h3>

		<h4>The Compass of Shame</h4>
		<p>Shame is a common response to conflict.  Dr. L. Nathanson describes the human reaction to shame as a compass with four poles: <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">The Compass of Shame"</a>.  Each represents our strongest reaction to shame.  While most of us experience each of the reactions at some point (or sometimes all at the same time) in our lives, we all have one of these reactions that is our typical response.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>North: Withdrawl - Self-imposed isolation, retreat from interaction with others.
				</li>

				<li>South: Avoidance - Attempt to hide and forget the feeling of shame.  Can involve addictive behavior such as alcohol abuse, over-eating, etc.  Can also manifest is self-aggrandizement so that you feel superior to others.
				</li>

				<li>East: Attack Self - Lets in that inner voice that extols all of your faults; self-blame.
				</li>

				<li>West: Attack Other - Puts the blame on others. Refuse to see how the self or some of the sources of conflict explained above may have spurred the conflict.
				</li>

			</ul>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>Reflection on Conflict</h3>

		<p><em>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? What was the source of the conflict? How did you handle that conflict? Did your actions make the conflict better or worse? If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything? What did you learn from this experience?</em></p>

		<p>I am honestly so skillful at avoiding conflict that I really had to dig deep to think about an instance in which a true conflict, not just a little argument with my brother, occured.  I had to think back to when I was working at a coffee shop and I felt that my coworker was not contributing as much as I was.  Had I been more mature, I would have realized how his priorities for the job differed, mainly because he had more significant drains on his time and paycheck outside of work.  If I recall correctly, I tried to ask him to do something, even though he was the supervisor, and this did not go over well with him.</p>
		<p>So, I withdrew!  This is still my go-to response to conflict, so much so that I rarely even approach conflict.  This response made things somewhat worse because we basically avoided each other for the rest of the short time that I worked there.  It is hard to know how I would have responded differently, but there probably would have been more discussion and communication about our differing perspectives so that we could find a resolution.  I think from the outset though, instead of responding to the conflict differently, I would have approached the situation from a standpoint of better communication so that a conflict did not arise in the first place.</p>
		<p>I also responded internally with both Attack Other and Attack Self.  I fixated on all of the things that he was doing wrong, but then eventually I came around to reflect on how I had contributed to the conflict.</p>
		<p>I think I learned from this experience that we have to put ourselves in the position of the other person and try to understand why they are reacting the way the are in a given situation.  I think I now typically avoid getting into conflict with others because I am fairly empathetic.  I usually see where someone else is coming from and then am better able to communicate with them so that no conflict arises.</p>
