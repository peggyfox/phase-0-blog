		<span class="title">The DBC Experience</span>
		<br>
		<span class="post_date">June 7, 2014</span>
		<p>
		<span class="post_content"> The DBC experience is just that - its based on experiential learning where the students are active drivers of their education and depends on students taking a creator mindset.  Students are presented with challenges and resources on how to complete the challenges, but very few of the steps are actually spelled out.  In this way, the student in challenged to essentially figure it out.  This model teaches people how to teach themselves to code, which is an essential skill to becoming a developer, as the process will take many years and technology itself is rapidly evolving. 
			<p>In programming, there are various ways to get from point A to point B.  The DBC model which makes you figure out how to get to B allows you to play which each of the ways, develop your understanding of them, and also maybe find out a little about how to get to point C, which is something you might use down the road.  My impression is that this model is very successful in jump-starting motivated students who already know they enjoy coding to become developers.  </p>

			<p>Already after one week of Phase 0 work, I have probably worked harder than in any previous educational experience, and I have definitely enjoyed it more.  I have come home from work every night to sit down and work through challenges, and at the end of the first week, having gotten less sleep than most weeks and definitely having work many more hours, I don't feel exhausted.  I actually feel more alert.  I feel engaged and like an active driver in my life - something I've been missing in my profession.  I'm excited - I've actually danced in my chair numerous times this week when I figured out how to do something I was struggling with.  How many times did I dance in my chair when writing papers in college?  Probably not once.  I came to Dev Bootcamp because I wanted the ability to create.  I wanted to learn the tools to be a maker, and already one week-in, I've made my own website!</p>

			<p>I am anxious about the next four months ahead for this experience with Dev Bootcamp.   I mean this in both an excited and nervous way.  I know I will be challenged both technically and emotionally.  I will probably doubt myself a lot.  I will probably be tired.  But I will also probably create things I can't even imagine right now.  And I will definitely do a lot of little dances in my chair along the way.</p></span>
