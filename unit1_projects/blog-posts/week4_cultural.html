		<span class="post_title">Tech's E-Waste Problem</span>
		<br>
		<span class= "tab" class="post_date">June 28, 2014</span>
		<p>
		<span class="post_content"> Advances in Information Technology have allowed us to reduce our impact on the environment in a myriad of ways.  Telecommuting helps reduce the energy consumption required to physically commute from place to place.  The transitional to digital allows for production of content without having to print or move that content.  And these are just two of the more pervasive aspects.

		<p>Despite the green benefits of IT, e-waste poses a serious environmental and social challenge to the tech community.  As new technologies are developed and consumers swap out their computers, iphone, and tablets, proper disposal of these devises is a growing challenge.</p>

		<p>Remember digital cameras?  They were those things you used for a few years that seemed to improve in megapixels by the month and that you eventually just replaced with your smart phone?  I bet you threw at least one, if not more, of those away, right?</p>

		<p>The main issue with e-waste is that many of the components in our electronics are toxic and their disposal, whether through recycling or in landfills, is a danger to human and environmental health.</p>

		<p>Retailers have improved their effort to provide recycling and repair services to consumers.  A lot of manufactures and retailers will take back the electronics that they sell you.  Best Buy, in particular, has built up an e-waste recycling program that will take anything from batteries to appliances.</p>

		<p>Once the consumer recycles it, though, what happens?  Some electronics are repaired or refurbished here in the US and then sold again either in the US or abroad.   A large part of our e-waste, however, is exported to developing countries.  There are a lot of statistics on e-waste out there on the Internet, many of which our out-of-date (the EPA still has 2009 figures on their website).  The actual numbers seem unreliable, but what is clear is that not all e-waste can or is actually recycled.  In many ways, developing countries such as China, India, and parts of Africa have becoming dumping grounds for this waste.</p>  

		<p>If you do a <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1101&bih=605&q=e+waste&oq=e+waste&gs_l=img.3...285.1888.0.1984.8.6.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1ac.1.48.img..8.0.0.5TXgssxflJI">Google Image search for e-waste</a> you&#39ll see a lot of pictures like the one below.  This certainly is one aspect of e-waste recycling that&#39s cause for concern.  As electronics are taken apart manually, people are exposed to the toxic components within.   This process can also involve burning the materials, specifically the plastic parts, to access the copper and other metals that can be used for local industry.</p>

		<p>That&#39s right, burning plastic!   We&#39re all aware of the carcinogenic effects of dioxins released by burning plastic (or at least we should be), so this process of &#39recycling&#39 e-waste is a definite problem for tech, one that industry and government alike are becoming more aware of.</p>

		<p>Not all recycling of e-waste in developing countries mirrors the process described above.  China has developed fairly sophisticated processes for re-incorporating e-waste into their manufacturing sector.  Nonetheless, there are still components of e-waste that cannot be recycled.  The graphic below shows the functional recycling rates of the 30 metals contained in the average cell phone.  This means that for some metals, only 25% of their value can be retained and recycled.  The rest of our waste, then, is being disposed of off-shore.</p>

		<h3><span class="arrow_small">> </span>So what are the solutions?</h3>

		<h4>Government Regulation</h4>
		<p>Many organizations that are vocal about the e-waste problem are pushing for more state and national regulations that would force manufactures and retailers to be responsible for the disposal of their products.  The regulations would ultimately encourage manufactures to create greener products and to export less of their waste.</p>

		<h4>The Fourth R: Repair</h4>
		<p>Organizations like iFixit emphasize an important additional to the traditional recycling mantra.  They propose we Reduce, Reuse, Repair, then Recycle.  You could really think of this as another type of reusing, but since it also starts with an R, let&#39s go with it.  Repairing (or refurbishing, which also starts with an R!) helps prevent the inevitable loss of material that occurs in the cycling of metals.</p>

		<h4>Built to Last</h4>
		<p>Sitting here typing on my Macbook, I&#39d like to propose another solution based on the old General Motors slogan &#39Built to last&#39.  Electronic companies need to focus on building products that will last.  When I was trying to decide whether to switch from a PC to a Mac, what I frequently heard from friends and saw on online forums was being saying that you&#39ll have a Mac for years.  They said that their technology does not go obsolete as quickly as PC&#39s and that they rarely experienced hardware or software issues with the computer that would require them to buy a new one.  Much of Apple&#39s great reputation as a company is derived from this very reliability of their products.  I think if more companies focused on building products that would last longer, we would also significantly reduce our e-waste problem, and improve our user experience in the process.</p>
